# PhotoMaps
Put your photos on a map and retrace your steps

This is my first app. It's a simple idea just to help me learn more about Swift and iOS Development. Working on this app has been a lot of fun, so I'm making it public in case it can be helpful to other people learning. 

If you have tips or suggestions open an Issue or send a Pull Request!

### About PhotoMaps

I love experiencing new cities by walking around, getting out of the obvious path, and I love taking lots of photos. Friends ask me for tips on cities I visited all the time, and just giving them a list of main places to go doesn't mean they'll have the same experience I had. This app let's me share the path I took, and the nice things I saw along the way. It's like giving my friends a guided tour.
